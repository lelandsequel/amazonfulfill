    "problem": "Planners rely on fragmented dashboards and manual workflows to identify network risk and make routing decisions. This leads to reactive planning, inconsistent service levels (SLA), and suboptimal capacity utilization.",
    "description": [
        "FFRO simulates the logic of an expert logistics planner to visualize network health.",
        "It ingests complex scenarios (Origin FCs, Destination Regions, Time Windows) and applies predictive modeling.",
        "The system assigns strict 'Service Level Risk Scores' and recommends specific routing changes to mitigate bottlenecks before they occur."

    "impact": [
        "Improved SLA performance through early detection of regional stress zones.",
        "Faster, more consistent routing decisions across regions.",
        "Reduced operational cost from better utilization and capacity balancing."
