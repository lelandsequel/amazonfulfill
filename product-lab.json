  "problem": "Amazon's fulfillment network relies on thousands of daily routing decisions across FCs, sort centers, and last-mile nodes. Existing tools are fragmented and reactive, making it hard to see emerging bottlenecks and proactively rebalance demand.",
  "description": [
    "Designed an internal FFRO console that combines short-term demand forecasts with network constraints (capacity, cut-off times, SLAs) to generate recommended routing plans.",
    "Modeled how orders flow across FCs and regional nodes, surfacing when and where the network will hit stress thresholds under different scenarios.",
    "Built planner workflows around simulation: planners can tweak constraints, rerun scenarios, and compare the impact of different routing strategies before committing."
  ],
  "impact": [
    "Reduces transportation and handling cost by 10–15% in modeled scenarios by routing to under-utilized capacity.",
    "Improves on-time delivery rates by surfacing SLA risk earlier and recommending corrective routing actions.",
    "Cuts manual planning time by giving planners a single place to run scenarios, approve plans, and push changes to downstream systems."
