  "proof": "I can model fulfillment constraints and translate them into a decision cockpit: demand forecasts + capacity + routing options + measurable tradeoffs.",
  "problem": "Fulfillment performance degrades when forecasts, capacity, and routing decisions live across disconnected tools. Teams react late to demand shifts, misallocate volume, and miss service-level targets because the network plan isn’t recomputed fast enough.",
  "impact": [
    "Improved forecast-to-plan cycle time by consolidating demand, capacity, and routing into one workflow.",
    "Reduced late-stage volume rework by surfacing constraint violations earlier (capacity, lane limits, service levels).",
    "Enabled faster scenario planning with clear tradeoffs across cost, time, and service performance."

    "FFRO is a hypothetical internal tool for Amazon network ops teams to forecast demand and generate routing recommendations across fulfillment nodes.",
    "It supports scenario planning and constraint-aware routing decisions so operators can recompute plans quickly when conditions change."
